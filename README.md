## üîß Projects

#### üõ°Ô∏è [SOC Automation Lab with Wazuh, TheHive, Sysmon, Shuffle, and VirusTotal](https://github.com/0xFroggi/Security-Operation-Center-SOC-Automation-Project)
- Deployed a Security Operations Center (SOC) automation lab to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats using Wazuh, TheHive, Sysmon, Shuffle, and VirusTotal.
- Configured Wazuh to collect and analyze logs from Sysmon for detailed event monitoring, such as process execution.
- Created custom rules in Wazuh to detect Mimikatz activity and validate alerts in the dashboard.
- Automated threat response workflows in Shuffle by enriching Wazuh alerts with VirusTotal, sending email notifications, and creating cases in TheHive for incident management.
- Streamlined SOC operations by integrating multiple tools for real-time threat detection, response, and reporting.


#### üõ°Ô∏è [Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Implementation in Homelab](https://github.com/0xFroggi/NessusProject)
- Deployed a Nessus vulnerability scanner in a homelab environment to identify and address security flaws.
- Configured a Windows virtual machine to be intentionally vulnerable by stopping automatic updates, turning off the firewall, and installing outdated, insecure software.
- Installed and configured Nessus on an Ubuntu Linux machine to perform scans and detect security issues on the Windows machine.

#### üõ°Ô∏è [AI-Based Malicious Content Detector Web Application](https://github.com/0xFroggi/AI-Based-Malicious-Content-Detector-Web-Application)
- Developed a machine learning model in Python to classify URLs and email content as malicious or benign.
- Integrated AI model into a Flask web application, enabling real-time analysis of user-submitted content.
- Utilized Python, Flask, and machine learning libraries for project development, achieving over 90% accuracy.
- Gained hands-on experience in AI, web development, and cybersecurity through project implementation.

#### üîí [Cloud-Based Password Manager Implementation](https://github.com/0xFroggi/PasswordManager)
- Deployed a password manager in a cloud environment to enhance secure access management and data protection.
- Configured a cloud-based virtual machine to host the password manager application, ensuring a secure and scalable infrastructure.
- Implemented secure access controls and encryption within the password manager to safeguard sensitive data and fortify the system against potential threats.



#### ‚òÅÔ∏è [Cloud-Based Network Performance Testing](https://github.com/0xFroggi/Cloud-Based-Network-Performance-Testing/tree/main)
- Deployed a cloud-hosted speed test platform using Docker containers.
- Utilized the LibreSpeed container image to conduct network speed tests.

#### üïµÔ∏è Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Testing in Homelab
- Established a homelab environment with Ubuntu and Kali Linux virtual machines.
- Configured and rigorously tested SNORT, an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS).
- Analyzed and fine-tuned SNORT rules to enhance network security and threat detection.
